Our Vision
===========

<div class="image"><img src="/assets/img/vision_lattice@x2.png" width="306" height="185" alt="" /></div>

We connect the dots between the best **emerging innovations** and the **financial**, **social**, and **human** capital to make them thrive.

<div class="image"><img src="/assets/img/vision_tools@x2.png" width="284" height="151" alt="" /></div>

We find **smart** people doing **creative** things, and we give them the **tools** to do them better.

We exist for social innovators and are run by social innovators.
-------------

We **identify gaps** then support those on the first line of response. If holes remain, we **incubate solutions**.

Across it all, we **build networks** to ensure that the **strongest ideas** have the best support systems.
