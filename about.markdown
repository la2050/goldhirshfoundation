About Us
===========

<div class="image image-world"><img src="/assets/img/about_world@x2.png" width="314" height="219" alt="" /></div>

The world is brimming with **innovators** whose ideas can shape our region and **change the world**. At the Goldhirsh Foundation, we identify the **brightest emerging talent** and give them the tools to best support their success.

We hold ourselves to the same **high standard** of the talent we seek to cultivate. We are a small team, passionate about our work in **social innovation**. We strive to manifest that beyond our investments—by creating events and mission-driven initiatives meant to bring together thinkers and doers across a **spectrum of disciplines**.

The Goldhirsh Foundation has been making grants for almost a decade, but was re-launched in 2012 in Los Angeles, where the majority of our  
grant-making occurs. In 2013, the Goldhirsh Foundation conducted its grantmaking via the [2013 My LA2050 Grants Challenge](http://myla2050.maker.good.is/). After a successful grants challenge in 2013, the Goldhirsh Foundation conducted its grantmaking in 2014, 2015, and 2016 via the [My LA2050 Grants Challenge](http://www.challenge.la2050.org), and 2018 via the [My LA2050 Activation Challenge](https://activation.la2050.org/).
