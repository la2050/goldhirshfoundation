About Us
===========

<div class="image image-world"><img src="/assets/img/about_world@x2.png" width="314" height="219" alt="" /></div>

The world is brimming with **innovators** whose ideas can shape our region and **change the world**. At the Goldhirsh Foundation, we identify the **brightest emerging talent** and give them the tools to best support their success.

We hold ourselves to the same **high standard** of the talent we seek to cultivate. We are a small team, passionate about our work in **social innovation**. We strive to manifest that beyond our investments—by creating events and mission-driven initiatives meant to bring together thinkers and doers across a **spectrum of disciplines**.

The Goldhirsh Foundation has been making grants for almost a decade, but was re-launched in 2012 in Los Angeles, where the majority of our grantmaking occurs. Since 2013, the Goldhirsh Foundation has conducted a large portion of its grantmaking in Los Angeles via the annual [My LA2050 Grants Challenge](challenge.la2050.org). Browse the more than 1,500 proposals to make Los Angeles better submitted through the grants challenges on the [My LA2050 Ideas Archive](https://archive.la2050.org/).
