**LA2050  announces $1,000,000  in grants to five winners  of the My LA2050 Grants Challenge to #ActivateforLA**

Today, the Goldhirsh Foundation has announced the winners of the 2018 [My LA2050 Activation Challenge](https://activation.la2050.org/), an open call for ideas designed to activate 100,000 Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1,000,000 will be awarded evenly among the five selected organizations to carry out their proposals over the next two years. Each organization will receive $200,000 and [partnership from LA2050](https://activation.la2050.org/about/#la2050-partnership) in support of its efforts. The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is part of LA2050’s effort to drive progress toward a shared vision of success for Los Angeles.

The winning proposals reflect conversations occurring at both national and local levels about timely topics such as refugee resettlement, gun safety, homelessness, STEM learning, and inclusive entrepreneurship.  “We are inspired by the projects selected for grants this year,” said Goldhirsh Foundation president, Tara Roth. “These proposals address issues of national import with impact at a local level. They are introducing creative solutions for community change by tapping into the collective efforts of Angelenos.”

Additionally, the Goldhirsh Foundation is delighted to partner with the Annenberg Foundation for the fourth year in the My LA2050 Grants Challenge. The Annenberg Foundation will provide each winner with an additional $25,000 grant to support the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.
