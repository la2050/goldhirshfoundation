Over the past several years, the Federal government has been working with local communities across the country on a wide range of initiatives that support innovation and opportunity. Several of these initiatives are listed below along with links that offer more information. Many have existing communities of practice that are open for new participants to join.  

**Promoting Diverse Talent**

Inclusion Pledges: To tap into talent across the country, companies and universities have taken pledges to take specific steps to be more representative of the American people.    

> **Tech Inclusion Pledge:** Eighty companies have joined an industry\-led pledge to make their technology workforces more representative of the American people by (1) implementing and publishing company\-specific goals to recruit, retain, and advance diverse technology talent; (2) annually publishing data and progress metrics on the diversity of our technology workforce; and (3) investing in partnerships to build a diverse pipeline of technology talent. For more information: [www.tech\-inclusion.org](http://www.tech-inclusion.org)
> 
> **American Society for Engineering Education Pledge:** More than 200 universities committed to building a more diverse student talent pipeline. For more information, click [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/EDC_DiversityInitiativeLetter_Nov2016.PDF).
> 
> **National Venture Capital Association Pledge:** 40 venture\-capital firms with more than $100 billion under management committed to help advance opportunities for all Americans, including women and underrepresented minorities. For more information click [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/nvca_white_house_demo_day_letter_0.pdf).
> 
> **Diversify Access to Capital Pledge:** More than 30 angel investor groups with over $800 million deployed in early stage science and technology investment dollars across the country committed to promoting inclusive entrepreneurship. More information [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/diversifycapitalpledge_Nov2016.pdf). 
> 
> **Computer Science for All (CSforAll):** CSforAll aims to provide all Pre\-K through grade 12 US students with access to high quality computer science education. CSforAll builds on efforts already being led by parents, teachers, school districts, states, and private sector leaders from across the country. More than 500 organizations have made public commitments and actions to support this goal. For more information [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/01/30/computer-science-all). 
> 
> **TechHire:** President Obama launched the TechHire initiative in 2015 to get more people from all backgrounds into the over 600,000 open tech jobs that pay 50 percent more than the average private\- sector job. A little over a year after launch, more than 1,500 employers in 70 communities – including Los Angeles – are working with new training programs such as coding boot camps, resulting in thousands of new hires. For more information [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/technology/techhire). Here's more information about [TechHire in LA:](https://techhire.org/community/los-angeles/)
> 
> **IMAGE of STEM:** Inclusion of diverse and compelling STEM images, stories, and positive messages in mainstream entertainment media, social media, and everyday materials can be a positive driver of broad inclusive talent engagement for the STEM workforce. There are key opportunities to work with public and private sector partners to: 1) highlight STEM role models (past and present); 2) emphasize social impacts and exciting aspects of STEM work to inspire students to tackle pressing challenges of the 21st century; and 3) debunk STEM stigmas and misconceptions.

**Collaborating to Tackle Big Challenges**  

**Grand Challenges: **As part of President Obama’s pledge “to restore science to its rightful place,” the Administration launched several Grand Challenges to enlist support from across the country – and across sectors – to tackle pressing issues. For more information on:
