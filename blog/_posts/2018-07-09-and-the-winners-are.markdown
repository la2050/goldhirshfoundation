## LA2050 announces $1,000,000 in grants to five winners of the My LA2050 Grants Challenge to #ActivateforLA

Today, the Goldhirsh Foundation has announced the winners of the 2018 [My LA2050 Activation Challenge](https://activation.la2050.org/), an open call for ideas designed to activate 100,000 Angelenos to make LA the best place to learn, create, play, connect, and live. A total of $1,000,000 will be awarded evenly among the five selected organizations to carry out their proposals over the next two years. Each organization will receive $200,000 and [partnership from LA2050](https://activation.la2050.org/about/#la2050-partnership) in support of its efforts. The My LA2050 Grants Challenge is part of LA2050’s effort to drive progress toward a shared vision of success for Los Angeles.

The winning proposals reflect conversations occurring at both national and local levels about timely topics such as refugee resettlement, gun safety, homelessness, STEM learning, and inclusive entrepreneurship.  “We are inspired by the projects selected for grants this year,” said Goldhirsh Foundation president, Tara Roth. “These proposals address issues of national import with impact at a local level. They are introducing creative solutions for community change by tapping into the collective efforts of Angelenos.”

Additionally, the Goldhirsh Foundation is delighted to partner with the Annenberg Foundation for the fourth year in the My LA2050 Grants Challenge. The Annenberg Foundation will provide each winner with an additional $25,000 grant to support the organization’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.

The winners of the My LA2050 Activation Challenge are:

### LEARN

### CREATE

[ELACC + LA Street Vendors Coalition](https://activation.la2050.org/create/east-la-community-corporation-elacc/): After winning a 10-year fight for the legalization of street vending in LA, the Los Angeles Street Vendor Campaign will continue to activate vendors, small businesses, policy makers, and food lovers across our city in the creation of an equitable economy inclusive of micro-entrepreneurs. Through this activation, they will grow security and opportunity for an innovative industry that contributes to LA’s vibrant food culture and economy.

### PLAY

[Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence](https://activation.la2050.org/play/the-brady-center-to-prevent-gun-violence/): The Brady Center is establishing a coalition that will build public, legal, and economic pressure to reform or shut down “bad apple gun dealers,” and make an impact on two of LA2050’s key metrics - per capita crime rates and perceived safety. With this campaign, they will activate Angelenos to take meaningful action to reduce gun violence and increase public safety.

### CONNECT

[Miry's List](https://activation.la2050.org/connect/mirys-list/): In partnership with EmpowerLA, Miry's List will activate individuals across LA to make their neighborhoods more welcoming to new arrival refugee families through volunteerism and engagement with Neighborhood Councils.
